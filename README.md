# learningReact
This is a repository of small react projects created just to learn and practice react. None of these projects are fully functioning webapps, more so, they are just small tutorials I followed and small groups of components I designed for learning and practicing.

See below for a list of projects completed and the thought process behind them.

Using react to build a basic shopping cart type component. This allows for adding new products / empty counters, removing counters, resetting counters to 0, increasing  and decreasing the number of counters, and showing the number of counters over 0 in a navigation bar.
