# learningReact

This is a repository of small react projects created just to learn and practice react. None of these projects are fully functioning webapps, more so, they are just small tutorials I followed and small groups of components I designed for learning and practicing.

See below for a list of projects completed and the thought process behind them.

### Benefits of React

- It is faster than web apps built with vanilla JS thanks to the virtual DOM.
- The reusability of web components which allows for making cleaner and easier to understand code.
- It is maintained by Facebook. This along with the open source and large community behind react means it is constantly updated to be the best it can be.
